A1_P2P is the main function, it could be used after inputting the correct parameters.
This function could be used for five types of copula function, including Gaussian, t, Frank, Clayton, Gumbel. The other types of the copula function are not included in this code, but it can be added in the same manner.
AF1_r_mapping_step1 is the subfunction of the A1_P2P.
